# Windsurf Setup

This repo includes Cursor-specific config (`.cursorrules`, `.cursor/commands/*`). Windsurf uses:

- Workspace rules: `.windsurf/rules/*.md`
- Workflows (slash commands): `.windsurf/workflows/*.md`

Because some environments block creating dot-prefixed paths programmatically, this repo also includes:

- `windsurf/rules/next-ai-starter.md`
- `windsurf/workflows/*.md`

To enable them in Windsurf, copy these into the corresponding `.windsurf/` directories (or create them via the Windsurf UI and paste the contents).
