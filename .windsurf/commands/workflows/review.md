# review

1. Review completed work against `agent-helpers/tasks/tasks.md`.
2. For each task:
   - Confirm the implementation matches the requirement.
   - Identify gaps/ambiguities and ask for clarification only if needed.
3. Use diffs to verify completeness (you may not have access to a running app).
4. Keep feedback actionable and concise.
