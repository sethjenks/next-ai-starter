# start

1. Read `agent-helpers/tasks/tasks.md` for the task checklist.
2. If relevant docs exist, read `agent-helpers/docs/*`.
3. Quickly map the codebase entry points and where the authoritative logic lives.
4. Implement tasks in order, minimizing scope and risk.
5. As you complete tasks, check them off in `agent-helpers/tasks/tasks.md`.
6. If you need clarification, ask only when truly blocking.
7. Before finishing, run `npm run build` and fix errors.

Important note:
- Start on a clean git branch. If the branch is not clean, ask the user to create a new branch.
